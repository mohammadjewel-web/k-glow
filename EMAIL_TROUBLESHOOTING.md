## Why You Might Not See the Email

3. Look for emails from: `jp@bismillahgoods.com`
4. Mark as "Not Spam" if found

### 2. Email Delay ⏰

Emails may take 1-5 minutes to arrive.

**Solution**: Wait a few minutes and refresh your inbox.

### 3. Email Filters 🔍

Your email client might have filters that move emails automatically.

**Solution**:

1. Check all folders (Promotions, Updates, Social, etc.)
2. Search for "K-Glow" in your email
3. Search for sender: "jp@bismillahgoods.com"

### 4. Email Quota Full 📦

If your email inbox is full, new emails may be rejected.

**Solution**: Delete old emails to free up space.

### 5. Domain Blocking 🚫

Your email provider might be blocking emails from the domain.

**Solution**: Add `jp@bismillahgoods.com` to your contacts/whitelist.
